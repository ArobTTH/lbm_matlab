    properties
        surface_normal          % vector of surface normal that points into the fluid domain.
        lattice_indices         % the lattice velocity indices that need to be advected from this cell.
        i                       % i index of this touched cell.
        j                       % j index of this touched cell.
        fluid_area              % the area of this cell that is present in the fluid domain.
        pgrams                  % handles of the pgrams that touch this cell.
        overlap_areas           % overlap areas with this cell, corresponding to pgrams / lattice_indices.
        non_overlap_area        % area that is not overlapped with the k surfel.
